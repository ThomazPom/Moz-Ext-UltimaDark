      description: |
        Please copy and paste any output from the browser console or extension log that seems unusual, denotes a problem, or looks related to your issueâ€”even if it's not an obvious error. This could be an error, a warning, or just something that stands out.
        You do not need to paste the entire logâ€”just the lines that seem connected to the problem (errors, warnings, or anything mentioning UltimaDark or the site).
